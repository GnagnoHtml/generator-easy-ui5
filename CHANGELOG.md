## 3.0.0 (2021-04-08)

### New Features

Starting with easy-ui5 v3, all templates will be outsource to repositories in the [UI5 Community](https://github.com/ui5-community/). This project is from now on a shell that will offer all generators hosted on that GitHub org. Easy-ui5 will download and install these repositories when needed.

By default, it will download the repository [generator-ui5-project](https://github.com/ui5-community/generator-ui5-project/) which contains the templates that were previously integrated in easy-ui5 < 3.
