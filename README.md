# [Easy UI5](https://ui5.sap.com/) Generator
>Easy-ui5 is a [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) generator which enables you to create simple OpenUI5-based web-apps within seconds.

<!-- *********************************************************************** -->

![OpenUI5 Logo](./docs/openui5.png)

This generator has been created to simplify the creation of your OpenUI5 prototypes. Now you can scaffold simple UI5 projects from the shell/terminal of your choice. The current best practices (such as [async](https://blogs.sap.com/2018/12/18/ui5ers-buzz-41-best-practices-for-async-loading-in-ui5/)) are already baked into our templates so you don't have to worry about the definition of the metadata files.

**Disclaimer:** The purpose of this generator is to guide you on your first steps with SAPUI5 and SAP Cloud Platform deployments. Once you are familiar with those technologies, you might want to tweak the projects to adapt them for productive use-cases (such as continuous deployment pipelines and full i18n).
Currently, we do **NOT** recommend that you use this plugin for production applications.


<!-- *********************************************************************** -->
